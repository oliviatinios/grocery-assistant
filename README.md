# Grocery Assistant
Grocery Assistant is an Android app which helps visually impaired grocery store customers navigate around a store and find products.
This project was built for a 4th year software engineering capstone course. You can find the full presentation slides here.

## Problem & Motivation
As of now, there aren't many options for visually impaired individuals when it comes to grocery shopping. You either have to do all your shopping online or wait until an employee in store is available to help you. The latter is difficult because employees are often busy doing other tasks and having to rely on an employee reduces an individual's independence. Because of this, individuals with a visual impairement often resort to buying groceries online.

## Solution
Our solution is to build a mobile application to assist with navigation that communicates with the user entirely through voice and vibrations.

## How It Works
: Step 1: Through voice commands, the user requests directions to an item in the grocery store.
: Step 2: The backend retrieves the coordinates of the item from the database.
: Step 3: A path is calculated between the user's position and the position of the item.
